# **GitHub 🇮🇳 Externships**


India is home to one of the largest communities of student developers in the world. In 2020 we saw the number of students participating in the GitHub Campus program increase by 142 per cent, over 100,000 students signed up to our GitHub Student Developer Pack and our campus offering was adopted by more than 100 higher-education institutions in India.

This growth is great to see, as the student ecosystem is incredibly important to the continued growth and pace of innovation in India.  However, students do not have enough opportunities to get mentorship that can make them real world ready and enhance their job prospects. 

To support this growing community of student developers and to address their need, today we’re launching **GitHub Externships**. This builds on **[GitHub Campus](https://education.github.com/schools)** offering by providing students a unique opportunity to engage with companies in India, via fellowship programs, and build the right skills future developers need, to succeed in an enterprise environment. The program really connects the dots between open source, the next generation of software developers, and successful companies.
