## 🧑‍💻  Open Source

The open-source ecosystem in India is thriving with many contributors & maintainers from India and open-source projects being built in India. We are here to help developers, contributors and maintainers in their journey towards open-source.

### GitHub Grants for Open Source

At [GitHub Satellite India 2021](https://githubsatellite.com), we announced the GitHub India Grants for Open Source to support the open source community by providing monetary grants to contributors/maintainers, with a total monetary fund of INR 1 crore.

For details about the program, eligibility and application process, [check out the program page](Open%20Source/GRANTS.md)

### Projects from India

There are many open-source projects that we might be using frequently, but unaware that it's a project that was created in or receiving significant contributions from India. We have collated some of the projects from India in this GitHub Explore Collection - [Made in India](https://github.com/collections/made-in-india)

If you know of any other projects from India, [Suggest an edit](https://github.com/github/explore/edit/main/collections/made-in-india/index.md?source=suggest-edits-made-in-india) and tag any one of the project's maintainers/admin in the comment of the PR.


### Resources

If you are looking to make your first contribution to open source, or even an experienced maintainer looking for ways to grow your community — we have resources to help you! Check out the [Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide) which has many resources on how to start an open-source project, build communities, best practices for maintainers, and a lot more!

## :octocat:  Developers

GitHub is the platform where millions of developers and companies build, ship and maintain their software. We help developers with the resources they need and showcase their awesome work to the rest of the community.

### Meetups

GitHub India Virtual Meetup group is for developers in India, by developers in India, and fuelled by the love for Open Source! [Join us on the Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/GitHub-India/) and come check out the latest on GitHub, learn about new open source projects, and meet maintainers & GitHub staff from India.

### GitHub Stars

The GitHub Stars program thanks GitHub’s most influential developers and gives them a platform to showcase their work, reach more people, and shape the future of GitHub. Say hello 👋🏼 to the [GitHub Stars from India!](https://stars.github.com/profiles/?country=India)

If you know an inspiring community leader, [we want to hear about it.](https://stars.github.com/nominate/)


### The ReadME Project

The ReadME Project is part of GitHub’s ongoing effort to amplify the voices of the developer community. It’s an evolving space to engage with the community and explore the stories, challenges, technology, and culture that surround the world of open source.

Check out the [story of Shikha Mishra](https://github.com/readme/shikha-mishra) from India

We’re always on the lookout for inspiring developers who passionately dedicate themselves to their communities. Know somebody whose story deserves to be told? [Let us know](https://github.com/readme/nominate), and they could end up being featured on The ReadME Project.

### Student Developer Pack

There's no substitute for hands-on experience. But for most students, real-world tools can be cost-prohibitive. That's why we created the GitHub Student Developer Pack with some of our partners and friends: to give students free access to the best developer tools in one place so they can learn by doing. Check out the tools and get your [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)
